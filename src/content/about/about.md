## About Me
I studied Computer Science and Cyber Security at the University of Queensland.
I graduated in 2025 with a Bachelor of Computer Science (Cyber Security) and
a Master of Cyber Security (Cyber Defence).

I enjoy systems programming, formal methods, and cyber security. When you do
all three at once, you get to say stuff like "I've proven this software
driver never leaks secret information," which is super neat. My Master's
degree final-project was on creating a tool to automatically detect where
weak memory models<sup>[
[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_model#Weak_memory_consistency_models)
]</sup> could break proofs (specifically Rely/Guarantee<sup>[
[2](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/cliff.jones/publications/SETSS-17.pdf)
]</sup> proofs) about the concurrent behaviour of a computer program.
