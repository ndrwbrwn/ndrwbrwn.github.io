### About Me
I studied Computer Science and Cyber Security at the University of Queensland. I graduated in 2025 with a Bachelor of Computer Science (Cyber Security) and a Master of Cyber Security (Cyber Defence).

I enjoy systems programming, formal methods, and cyber security. When you do all three at once, you get to say stuff like "I've proven this software driver never leaks secret information," which is super neat. My thesis topic was on creating a tool to automatically detect where weak memory models<sup>[1]</sup> could break proofs (specifically Rely/Guarantee proofs) about the concurrent behaviour of a computer program.

When I have the time to not be staring at a computer, I like to go camping, hiking, and four-wheel-driving. Occasionally I try to be good at freerunning.
